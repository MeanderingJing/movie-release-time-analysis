# movie-release-time-analysis
## Objective
Investigates the relationship between a movie's release timing and its box office profitability. 
## Key Methods
- Chi-square test
- Association rule mining
- Multinomial logistic regression
## Dataset
- Sourced from Kaggle 
- Movies from 2003-2023, 2750 records

## Statistical Analysis (Chi-square Test of Independence)
### Statistically Significant Findings
- Chi-square statistic: 80.306
- p-value: < 0.05 (significant)
### Key Takeaway 
Release month and box office profitability (ROI) are statistically associated.
## Assocoation Rule Mining

- Support: The frequency of an itemset appearing in the dataset
- Confidence: The confidence of a rule A â†’ B is the likelihood that B appears in transactions where A appears.
- Lift:  Lift measures the strength of a rule over the random occurrence of B, given A. A lift value >1 means A and B are more likely to appear together than expected by chance, suggesting a meaningful association.
## Multinomial Logistic Regression (Predicting for multiple ROI categories)
### Features (predictors)
- month of release, genre (one-hot encoding)
- budget, rating (standard scaling)
### Target variable: 
High ROI, Moderate ROI, Low ROI
### Data splitting: 90% training, 10% testing 
### Training Process: Logistic Regression classifier (scikit-learn, ML library)
- Solver: lbfgs is chosen, a method suitable for smaller datasets.
- Class Weight: balanced option ensures that the model compensates for class imbalance.
- Max Iterations: max_iter=1000 ensures sufficient iterations to find the best-fit model coefficients
