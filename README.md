- Support: The frequency of an itemset appearing in the dataset
- Confidence: The confidence of a rule A â†’ B is the likelihood that B appears in transactions where A appears.
- Lift:  Lift measures the strength of a rule over the random occurrence of B, given A. A lift value >1 means A and B are more likely to appear together than expected by chance, suggesting a meaningful association.
